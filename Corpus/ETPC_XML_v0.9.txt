# Usage documentation on ETPC corpus version 0.9
# This document describes the structure of the file structure in the XML version of ETPC
# N.B.: This document is relevant to version 0.9 of the corpus. For other versions please refer to the corresponding documentation
# N.B.: The corpus is still undergoing post-processing and version 1.0 should be available shortly including changelog from 0.9

The XML version of the corpus contains 5 files

- text_pairs.xml contains the MRPC corpus (raw):
  - pair_id is internal id of the pair, used in the other files
  - sent1_id and sent2_id are the original IDs of the sentences in MRPC (for backtracking)
  - sent1_raw and sent2_raw are the raw text of the two sentences in MRPC
  - sent1_tok and sent2_tok are the result of nltk.word_tokenize() applied to the raw text
      N.B.: The type annotation was performed on the tokenized version of the corpus
  - mrpc_label is the original textual label of the pair in MRPC (0 - non paraphrase, 1 - paraphrase)
  - etpc_label is the re-annotated textual label in ETPC (0 - non paraphrase, 1 - paraphrase)
      N.B.: There are some significant differences between mrpc_label and etpc_label! Users of the corpus should choose one (mrpc_label has 
      backwards compatibility) and stick with it. Both are provided for convenience. Only ONE of them should be used!
  - negation determines whether the pair contain negation or not (0 - no negation, 1 - negation)
  
  - The first 4076 pairs (pair_id from 1 to 4076) correspond to the original "training" set in the MRPC. The remaining pairs (pair_id >
      4076) correspond to the original "test" set in MRPC.
  
The other 4 files (negation.xml, textual_paraphrases.xml, textual_np_pos.xml, textual_np_neg.xml) have the same structure:

  - pair_id corresponds to the pair_id in text_pairs.xml
  - type_id corresponds to the numeric ID of the atomic type
  - type_name corresponds to the name of the atomic type
  - sense_preserving indicates whether the atomic pair is sense preserving or non-sense preserving
  - s1_scope, s2_scope are numeric lists of token ids that belong to the scope of the phenomena
  - key_s1, key_s2 are numeric lists of token ids that belong to the key of the phenomena (for more information, see the 
  full EPT and the annotation guidelines)
  - s1_text, s2_text, k1_text, k2_text are the text corresponding to the IDs in s1_scope, s2_scope, key_s1, and key_s2

  - The specifications and differences in the four files are as follows:
    - negation.xml: contains the negation, the scope of negation (s1_scope, s2_scope) and the negation markers (key_s1, key_s2)
    - textual_paraphrases.xml: contains the MRPC-A corpus by Vila et al. 2015. This is the annotation of all pairs originally annotated as
        textual paraphrases in the MRPC corpus (pairs with mrpc_label=1). 
        N.B.: In many cases, the "paraphrase" state of the pairs is questioned (etpc_label is different from mrpc_label). Keep that in mind 
        if you use etpc_label! 
        N.B.: In version 0.9 the numeric scope and key (s1_scope, s2_scope, key_s1, key_s2) are not available. Only the textual scope and key
        are in the file. Version 1.0 should resolve this issue.
        N.B.: The typology used in MRPC-A only has one type of Same Polarity Substitution, the contextual one. We are in the process of
        re-annotating all SPS into three categories corresponding in ETPC - habitual, contextual, named entity. Only around half of the
        instances of SPS are annotated as of version 0.9. Version 1.0 should resolve this issue. For most practical purposes this should
        not affect the usability of the corpus
    - textual_np_pos.xml and textual_np_neg.xml contain the annotation of pairs originally annotated as textual non-paraphrases in the
        MRPC corpus (pairs with mrpc_label=0). _pos contains all atomic types that are sense preserving. _neg contains all atomic types
        that are non-sense preserving.
