# Usage documentation on ETPC corpus version 0.9
# This document describes the structure of the database table in the SQL version of ETPC
# N.B.: This document is relevant to version 0.9 of the corpus. For other versions please refer to the corresponding documentation
# N.B.: The corpus is still undergoing post-processing and version 1.0 should be available shortly including changelog from 0.9

# N.B.: DB structure changelog from version 0.8 - none. 0.8 and 0.9 are fully compatible, the only change is on the content

etpc_all.sql contains 4 tables: atomic_anno, paraphrase_types, raw_pairs, text_anno

- paraphrase_types is purely informative table. It contains the Extended Paraphrase Typology (EPT) with the IDs associated to each type
- N.B.: negation ID is 100, it is not in the paraphrase_types table

- raw_pairs contains the MRPC corpus (raw):
  - pair_id is internal id of the pair, used in the other tables
  - label is the original label given to the pair in MRPC (1 - paraphrase, 0 - non paraphrase)
  - sent1_id and sent2_id are the original IDs of the sentences in MRPC (for backtracking)
  - s1_content and s2_content are the raw text of the two sentences in MRPC
  - s1_token and s2_token are the result of nltk.word_tokenize() applied to s1_content and s2_content
  
- text_anno contains the annotation for the first (textual) layer
  - pair_id corresponds to the pair_id in raw_pairs
  - label is the label associated to the pair by our annotators (1 - paraphrase, 0 - non paraphrase)
      N.B.: For the pairs that were originally annotated as non-paraphrases, we manually re-evaluated them as paraphrases or non-paraphrases
            For the pairs that were originally annotated as paraphrases, we relied on the annotation of Vila et al. 2015. We re-annotated as 
            "non-paraphrases" any pair that contains a "non-paraphrase" element.
  - negation is the presense or lack of negation (1 - negation, 0 - no negation)

- atomic_anno contains the annotation for the second (atomic) layer and the third (negation) layer
  - pair_id corresponds to the pair_id in raw_pairs
  - type_id corresponds to the type_id in paraphrase_types
  - s1_scope, s2_scope are numeric lists of token ids that belong to the scope of the phenomena
  - key_s1, key_s2 are numeric lists of token ids that belong to the key of the phenomena (for more information, see the 
  full EPT and the annotation guidelines)
  - s1_text, s2_text, k1_text, k2_text are the text corresponding to the IDs in s1_scope, s2_scope, key_s1, and key_s2
  (informative only)
  - type_polarity indicates whether the atomic pair is sense preserving (1,9) or non-sense preserving (0)
